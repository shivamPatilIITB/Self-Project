**Resume points:**

Analysis of MIMO, Spatial Modulation and mmWave Channel Estimation | Python 

(a) Plotted and analyzed the BER performance of zero forcing and LMMSE receivers with increasing SNR

(b) Simulated the variation of MIMO capacity with SNR for equal power allocation and that based on waterfilling

(c) Implemented the mmWave MIMO channel estimation using OMP algorithm for sparse vector estimation

(d) Implemented spatial modulation and space shift keying to analyze their BER performances
